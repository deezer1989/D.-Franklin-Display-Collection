## About the Collection

This collection is the personal art and object collection of D. Franklin and represents the
current decorative display in the apartment of the collector. Materials have been acquired
either through a gift from family or friends, bought by the collector directly, or have been
acquired with consent but no financial trade. Materials in this collection have been acquired
sporadically between the years of 2017 to 2024. Materials are either displayed in a curated
altar on top of a bookshelf, on a smaller side table, or are hung up on the walls. Represented in
this collection are religious materials that connect to the collectors Catholic heritage, multiple California Raisin figurines: this series began with the first acquired figurine that belonged to the collectors maternal grandmother, personal family photographs depicting collectors family and friends, as well as a series of prints and cards from Pittsburgh artist Calvin Lynch (1931-2022). The Lynch series were collected during a past employment at a Pittsburgh museum. All materials have a specific relation to certain moments, identities, or personal decorative style of the collector. Miscellaneous materials correspond to remaining materials not captured in aforementioned series, the majority of this series is various prints. Features seen in this collection as well are materials related to medieval art history, relating to the collectors academic focus for their bachelor degree obtained at the University of Pittsburgh.
